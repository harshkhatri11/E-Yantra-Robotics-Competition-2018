# Semifinalist of Homecoming-E-Yantra-Robotics-Competition-2018-

Theme : Homecoming (HC)
- The Indian sub-continent is home to an amazingly wide variety of wildlife that resides in the diverse terrain of the country. From Bengal and Indochinese tigers to various species of Deer, including Chital, Hangul, Barasingha, India preserves this huge variety of animals in its 120 national parks, 18 Bio-reserves and more than 500 wildlife sanctuaries. Moreover, India has some of the most biodiverse regions of the world. 
- Motivated by this, in this edition of e-Yantra Robotics Competition (eYRC-2018) we present the theme Homecoming
- After visiting a plethora of fauna in our Jungle Safari, letâ€™s check our general knowledge about different types of animals and their natural habitats. We see some of the largest habitats which include Oceans, Wetlands, Forest, Grasslands, Deserts, Mountains etc. and the animals that reside there.
- The arena for the theme is a simplified abstraction of an ecosystem in the grid-form. The goal is to devise an autonomous robot to negotiate a path on the arena to visit the Animals and Habitats and identify them using Machine Learning algorithms. It then picks up the identified Animals and places them in their respective Habitat on the arena.
- The challenges in the theme include Machine Learning for identification (of Animals and Habitats), sensor interfacing for path traversal and designing of a mechanism for picking and placing the Animals.
- The team that finishes the given task in the least amount of time whilst incurring the least penalties will be declared the winner.
