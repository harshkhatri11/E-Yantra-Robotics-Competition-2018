# 🌟 Semifinalist - E-Yantra Robotics Competition 2018 | Homecoming | Top 10


## 🎯 Theme: Homecoming (HC)

The **Indian subcontinent** is home to a diverse range of wildlife, from **Bengal and Indochinese tigers** to various species of **Deer (Chital, Hangul, Barasingha)**. With **120 national parks, 18 bio-reserves, and over 500 wildlife sanctuaries**, India is one of the most biodiverse regions in the world.

Inspired by this, the **e-Yantra Robotics Competition (eYRC-2018)** introduced the theme **"Homecoming"**, challenging participants to build an autonomous robot capable of recognizing and sorting animals into their respective habitats.
